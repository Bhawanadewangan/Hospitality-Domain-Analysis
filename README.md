### AtliQ Hospitality Analysis

#### Problem Statement

AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, AtliQ Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of AtliQ Grands wanted to incorporate ‚ÄúBusiness and Data Intelligence‚Äù to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights. Their revenue management team had decided to hire a 3rd party service provider to provide them with insights from their historical data.

dim_hotels - This table provided crucial details about the properties, including property ID, property name, category, and cities. It was essential for understanding the hotel chain's properties and their characteristics.

dim_rooms - This table included information about room IDs and room classes. We used this data to analyze which types of rooms were more popular or profitable.

fact_aggregated_bookings - This fact table contained data related to property ID, check-in dates, room categories, successful bookings, and capacity. It served as a crucial source for calculating key metrics related to bookings and occupancy.
